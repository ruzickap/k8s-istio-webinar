# Istio webinar

[Istio](https://istio.io/) is an open platform to connect, secure, control
and observe microservices, also known as a service mesh, on cloud platforms
such as Kubernetes.

![Istio](./.vuepress/public/istio.svg "Istio")

With Istio, you can manage network traffic, load balance across microservices,
enforce access policies, verify service identity, secure service communication,
and observe what exactly is going on with your services.
